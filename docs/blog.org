#+TITLE: blog
* Overview
Being a technology company, this blog is mostly about hardware and software. Blogging
itself is also a great tool for me personally to alleviate writer's block and develop
new features quickly. My goal is to write a few posts every month and allow community
members to share their own articles on the offical blog too.

Nothing is too far-fetched to be posted here, so be sure to use the tags to find posts
that interest you.
