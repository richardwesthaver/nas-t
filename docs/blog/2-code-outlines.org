#+TITLE: Code Outlines
* Overview
Source code files are hard to manage. They can get unwieldly quickly and making the
wrong assumption about your whereabouts in the code tree can have unintended
consequences.

There are many ways to solve this problem to different degrees. We'll be talking about
one strategy in particular which I use and recommend for any software project.

* Outlines
Looking through the source code in the NAS-T repository you'll find some common
commenting patterns - every file start with at least one comment line for example. These
patterns are used to provide structure, and that structure is used to quickly navigate
our code with Emacs.
