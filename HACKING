NOTES:
- NAS-T's core langs are Common Lisp and Rust. We use the most recent
stable versions of SBCL and the Rust compiler.

- The source is under Mercurial version control. If you wish to
contribute your changes upstream, it is recommended to use the
upstream source.

- To load the Common Lisp systems you will need the following
dependencies (not on quicklisp):
  - SXP   - https://lab.rwest.io/ellis/sxp
  - ORGAN - https://lab.rwest.io/ellis/organ

- The website code at infra/web requires the Trunk program for
building the web assets which you can install with cargo.

- GNU/Linux is the primary compile target for all software,
but other Unix-like platforms are supported (MacOS).

- Microsoft Windows is not supported.
