* Overview
Color palettes are an important element of the overall company
branding and form the basis for our UI designs. The /palettes/
available here provide collections of colors in a few portable
formats: SXP, JSON, and CSV. You can use these as an input to a
script, or use this document as a guide for implementing them in your
UI manually.
