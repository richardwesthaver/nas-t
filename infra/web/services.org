* Deployment
We offer on-site deployment services for all customers within our
service area. Our most prized asset is our relationships with
community members and we have a passion for educating folks from all
backgrounds in how to control and manage their personal data.
* On-site Support
Sometimes there's a solution, but it's tricky to implement. Other
times it's just easier to call in the experts so you can focus on
bigger things. Whatever the need, we're just a call or ping away.
* Expert Support
We provide a 1-on-1 support subscription with an expert which is
available for a small monthly fee and includes the option to receive
software updates and access to our beta environment where
early-development features are available for you to experiment with.
* Enterprise Support
Our Enterprise Support package is for organizations who want to
integrate NAS-T as a tool in their business. We provide consulting,
in-house development, training, and maintenance services.
