At NAS-T we value your privacy and your right to own your personal
data without exception. We aim to provide the <i>best</i> private cloud
storage software using cutting-edge technology which the large,
entrenched service providers aren't capable of implementing at scale,
and we do it at no cost to our users. We will sell hardware and
services at fair and transparent costs to support our mission and
encourage everyone to take back their data.
