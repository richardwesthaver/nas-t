The motivation for NAS-T comes from personal frustration with modern
cloud storage services. What started as simple file-sharing has turned
into 'Web File Systems' with a contagious vendor lock-in
effect. Everyone has experienced this at some point - try switching
from Apple to Android, or Windows to Mac, Google Cloud to DropBox. Why
is this so hard? It is because these services are all designed to
protect 'your' data from yourself.
