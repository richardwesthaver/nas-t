provider based in New London, CT. We are a group of IT and Data
specialists offering a replacement for managed cloud storage services
such as Google Drive, DropBox, iCloud, and OneDrive.

At NAS-T we value your privacy /and/ your right to own your data
without exception. We aim to provide the best /private/ cloud storage
service software using cutting-edge technology which the large,

cost. We aim to build a community of NAS enthusiasts and experts who
can share their experience and empower their local communities. We
will sell hardware and services at fair and transparent costs to
support our mission and encourage everyone to take back their data."
